## Javascript

- EventListeners are well written
- The function `getRandomInBetween` is good
- The function `incrementScore` is good
- You kept all the variables inside the closure (and you made the closure).
- The structure of the `generateNewSquare` function is good, just a misunderstanding on how to randomize the square creation

All the work you did is right, this is sad that you didn't do everything!

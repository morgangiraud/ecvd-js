## Javascript

- The game is very close to working
- The function `incrementScore` is good
- The structure of the function `generateNewSquare` is good
- The structure of the function `nextTurn` is good
- The function `endGame` is good, just missing the localStorage
- The function `startTimer`
- EventListeners are close to be good:
  - When use `if` statements to control the target, merge all the `if` inside one eventListener

You were really close to be able to restart the game, but you set the `timer` variable to `null` which breaks your code and you commented out the `startTimer` and `nextTurn` functions. 
You made two listeners to restart the game which is too much, the click event will propagate and restart the game twice.

Well done !

On the algorithm part, all the work you did is good!

The work done on javascript is pretty good, the code is a little messy but you were pretty close to make everything works. You must focus more and avoid giving up!
